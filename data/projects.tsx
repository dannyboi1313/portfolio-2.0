    "Developed an internal web app for the Licence & Maintenance team to streamline software license requests. I took on roles as a project manager, UI/UX designer, and developer, overseeing the project from start to finish. The team managed complex workflows, often spanning up to a year, while data scattered across systems hindered user-friendliness. My task was to create a unified platform, granting customers insights into request status and lifecycle. With a constant focus on maintainability and reusability, I designed and built the app to meet these needs.",
